**Input Type:** Text

**Input:**
```
The concept of neural networks draws inspiration from the human brain's structure and functionality. Neural networks consist of interconnected nodes or "neurons" organized in layers. The input layer receives data, hidden layers process it through weighted connections, and the output layer produces the final result. Each neuron applies an activation function to the weighted sum of its inputs. Training involves adjusting these weights through backpropagation, minimizing the difference between predicted and actual outputs. Neural networks excel at pattern recognition, classification, and prediction tasks, forming the foundation of deep learning. Modern architectures include convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image processing and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential data.
```

**Analysis:**
- Action: summarize
- Reason: Text is relatively complex (complexity score 0.68 > threshold of 0.65)
- Word Count: 102

**Output:**
```
Neural networks are modeled after the human brain with interconnected neurons in layers. They include input, hidden, and output layers where neurons apply activation functions to weighted inputs. Training uses backpropagation to adjust weights by minimizing prediction errors. Neural networks are effective for pattern recognition and form the basis of deep learning, with specialized architectures like CNNs for images and RNNs for sequences.

Introduction to Quantum Computing
Professor: Dr. Sarah Johnson
Date: September 14, 2023

Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in computational power, leveraging quantum mechanical phenomena to process information in ways classical computers cannot. This lecture covers the fundamental concepts of quantum computing, including qubits, superposition, entanglement, and quantum gates.
```

**Analysis:**
- Action: summarize
- Reason: Text is lengthy (2156 words > threshold of 500)
- Word Count: 2156

**Output:**
```
This lecture introduces quantum computing as a revolutionary computational approach that uses quantum mechanical phenomena beyond classical computing capabilities. Key concepts covered include qubits, superposition, entanglement, and quantum gates. The lecture explains how quantum computers leverage these principles to potentially solve problems that are intractable for classical computers, particularly in cryptography, optimization, and simulation of quantum systems.
