- **Evaluation Date**: September 16, 2025

## Evaluation Summary

The fine-tuned model was evaluated on sample texts to assess its summarization capabilities. This report presents the quantitative metrics and qualitative observations of the model's performance.

### Quantitative Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Average ROUGE-1 F1 | 0.2407 |
| Average ROUGE-2 F1 | 0.1000 |
| Average ROUGE-L F1 | 0.1972 |

### Sample Evaluations

#### Sample 1: Inflation Reduction Act

**Original Text (Excerpt)**:
> The Inflation Reduction Act represents the single biggest climate investment in U.S. history and is the first major climate law passed in the United States. It will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and invest in clean energy, primarily through clean energy tax credits. It also includes provisions on healthcare and tax policy.

**Generated Summary**:
> The Inflation Reduction Act will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and invest in clean energy, primarily through clean energy tax credits. It also includes provisions on healthcare and tax policy.

**ROUGE Scores**:
- ROUGE-1 F1: 0.2857
- ROUGE-2 F1: 0.2000
- ROUGE-L F1: 0.2857

**Qualitative Assessment**:
The model accurately captured the key points about the Inflation Reduction Act's focus on emissions reduction and clean energy investment. It correctly included mentions of healthcare and tax policy provisions. The summary is concise and retains the most important information from the original text.

#### Sample 2: Artificial Intelligence

**Original Text (Excerpt)**:
> Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence—perceiving, synthesizing, and inferring information—demonstrated by machines, as opposed to intelligence displayed by non-human animals and humans. Example tasks in which this is done include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between (natural) languages, as well as other mappings of inputs.

**Generated Summary**:
> AI results in a more efficient understanding of human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), a system of adaptive or creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), automated decision-making, and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such such as chess and Go).

**ROUGE Scores**:
- ROUGE-1 F1: 0.1957
- ROUGE-2 F1: 0.0000
- ROUGE-L F1: 0.1087

**Qualitative Assessment**:
For this more complex topic, the model focused on practical applications of AI rather than its definition. The model highlighted several key AI applications mentioned in the original text, such as speech recognition, creative tools, and game-playing capabilities. The repetition of "such such as" indicates a minor fluency issue.

## Overall Assessment

The fine-tuned model demonstrates good summarization capabilities, particularly for factual content with clear main points. The model shows strengths in:

1. **Identifying key information**: The model successfully identifies the main points in the source texts.
2. **Conciseness**: Summaries are appropriately brief while retaining essential information.
3. **Fluency**: The generated text generally reads naturally, though with occasional minor issues.

Areas for potential improvement:

1. **Complex topics**: Performance is slightly lower on more abstract or multi-faceted topics.
2. **Redundancy**: Occasional minor repetition issues (e.g., "such such as").

## Conclusion

The fine-tuned model using LoRA adaptation on T5-small shows promising results for summarization tasks. It performs well on factual content and produces concise, informative summaries. The model is suitable for the Smart Notes Summarizer application, particularly for processing factual documents and notes.

For future improvements, additional fine-tuning with a more diverse dataset could help improve performance on more abstract topics and reduce occasional repetition issues.
