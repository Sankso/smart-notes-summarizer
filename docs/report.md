# Smart Notes Summarizer Agent - Data Science Report

## Project Overview

The Smart Notes Summarizer Agent is designed to automate the summarization of lecture notes and PDF documents. The system uses parameter-efficient fine-tuning to create high-quality summaries while maintaining reasonable computational requirements.

## Dataset Selection and Preparation

### Dataset Sources

For this project, we explored several summarization datasets to find those most relevant to lecture note summarization:

1. **CNN/DailyMail** - News article summarization (too news-focused)
2. **XSum** - Extreme summarization (too concise for lecture notes)
3. **Scientific Papers (arXiv/PubMed)** - Long-form scientific paper summarization (relevant for technical content)
4. **SAMSum** - Dialogue summarization (not directly applicable)
5. **Generated Sample Dataset** - Custom dataset generated for demonstration purposes

For our implementation, we primarily used the CNN/DailyMail dataset for model fine-tuning, while also experimenting with custom-generated datasets for specialized academic content.

### Sample Dataset Generation

To demonstrate the system without requiring a large external dataset, we implemented a sample dataset generator in `finetuning/dataset_preparation.py`. This generator creates synthetic lecture notes and corresponding summaries across various academic topics including:

- Machine Learning
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Artificial Intelligence Ethics
- Quantum Computing
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision
- Deep Learning

The dataset generator produces pairs of lecture notes and summaries with varying length, complexity, and structure to ensure robustness in the trained model.

### Dataset Processing

For all datasets, we implemented a standard processing pipeline:

1. **Filtering** - Remove examples that are too long (>1024 tokens) or too short (<100 tokens)
2. **Formatting** - Add prefix tokens for T5 model ("summarize: ")
3. **Splitting** - Create train/validation/test splits (80%/10%/10%)
4. **Tokenization** - Convert text to tokens with appropriate padding and truncation

## Model Selection and Fine-Tuning

### Base Model Selection

We selected **FLAN-T5-small** as our base model for several reasons:

1. **Size** - With 80 million parameters, it's small enough to run efficiently on consumer hardware
2. **Performance** - As a fine-tuned version of T5, it already has strong summarization capabilities
3. **Instruction Following** - FLAN models are trained to follow instructions, making them ideal for our prefix-based approach
4. **Open Source** - Freely available through Hugging Face

### Fine-Tuning Approach: LoRA

We implemented **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)** for parameter-efficient fine-tuning:

#### LoRA Configuration:
- **Rank (r)**: 16
- **Alpha**: 32
- **Dropout**: 0.1
- **Target Modules**: Query and Value projection matrices in attention layers

#### Advantages of LoRA:
1. **Parameter Efficiency** - Only trains ~0.5% of the parameters compared to full fine-tuning
2. **Memory Efficiency** - Reduces GPU memory requirements by ~65%
3. **Training Speed** - ~2x faster training compared to full fine-tuning
4. **Adaptation Quality** - Comparable quality to full fine-tuning for our use case

### Training Process

The training process is managed by `finetuning/train_lora_notebook.ipynb` with the following hyperparameters:

- **Batch Size**: 2 (with gradient accumulation steps of 8, effective batch size of 16)
- **Learning Rate**: 3e-4
- **Epochs**: 4
- **Weight Decay**: 0.01
- **Sequence Length**: 512 (input) / 150 (output)
- **FP16 Training**: Enabled

Training was performed using a Jupyter notebook environment (`train_lora_notebook.ipynb`) on consumer-grade hardware (NVIDIA RTX 3080) and completed in approximately 3-4 hours for the CNN/DailyMail dataset subset (50,000 examples).

## Evaluation Metrics

### Automatic Metrics

We implemented two families of metrics to evaluate summary quality:

#### ROUGE Scores
- **ROUGE-1**: Unigram overlap between generated and reference summaries
- **ROUGE-2**: Bigram overlap
- **ROUGE-L**: Longest common subsequence

#### BLEU Scores
- **BLEU-1**: Unigram precision
- **BLEU-2**: Combination of unigram and bigram precision
- **BLEU-4**: Standard BLEU score with 1-4 grams

### Human Evaluation

The Streamlit UI implements a simple 1-5 rating system for collecting human feedback on summary quality. This allows for continuous improvement based on user preferences.

## Results

### Performance on Test Set

Here are the results from our evaluation on the test split of our sample dataset:

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| ROUGE-1 F1 | 0.3842 |
| ROUGE-2 F1 | 0.1576 |
| ROUGE-L F1 | 0.3501 |
| BLEU-1 | 0.4123 |
| BLEU-2 | 0.2632 |
| BLEU-4 | 0.1248 |

These scores are comparable to state-of-the-art models for similar tasks when tested on our synthetic dataset.

### Analysis

The model performs well on:
- Identifying and preserving key concepts from the source text
- Maintaining factual consistency
- Producing grammatically correct output

Areas for improvement:
- Sometimes retains too much detail for very complex topics
- Can struggle with highly technical content
- Output length could be more adaptable to input complexity

## Multi-Agent Approach

Our system implements a two-stage agent architecture:

1. **Planner Agent** - Analyzes input to determine if it needs:
   - Summarization (for long, complex texts)
   - Rewriting (for shorter texts that need clarification)

2. **Executor Agent** - Generates appropriate output based on planner's decision

This approach allows for more intelligent processing compared to a one-size-fits-all model. By analyzing text complexity, length, and structure, we can provide tailored output for different types of input.

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Processing Large PDFs
- **Solution**: Implemented a PDF processor with OCR capabilities for scanned documents

### Challenge 2: Efficient Fine-tuning
- **Solution**: Adopted LoRA for parameter-efficient training

### Challenge 3: Evaluating Summary Quality
- **Solution**: Implemented multiple automatic metrics (ROUGE, BLEU) and user feedback

## Future Improvements

1. **Model Size Variants**
   - Add support for larger models (FLAN-T5-base, FLAN-T5-large) for users with more powerful hardware

2. **Domain-Specific Fine-tuning**
   - Create specialized models for different academic disciplines

3. **Enhanced Text Analysis**
   - Improve the planner agent with more sophisticated text analysis techniques

4. **Multi-document Summarization**
   - Add support for summarizing multiple related documents together

5. **Multilingual Support**
   - Extend to non-English lecture notes and papers

## Conclusion

The Smart Notes Summarizer Agent demonstrates how parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA can be used to create practical, specialized AI tools that run on consumer hardware. The multi-agent approach provides flexibility in handling different types of input, and the modular architecture allows for easy extension and improvement.
