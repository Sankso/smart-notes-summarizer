# Model Evaluation

This document describes the evaluation framework and results for the Smart Notes Summarizer project.

## Evaluation Approach

The Smart Notes Summarizer uses a comprehensive evaluation framework to assess the quality of generated summaries across different types of content. Our evaluation approach includes:

1. **Diverse Text Categories**: Testing across multiple text types to measure model versatility
   - Short factual texts
   - Medium-length news articles
   - Technical content
   - Abstract/conceptual content
   - Narrative texts

2. **Multiple Parameter Settings**: Testing different generation parameters to understand trade-offs
   - Default settings: balanced approach
   - More diverse settings: higher creativity, potentially lower precision
   - More focused settings: higher precision, potentially less coverage

3. **Comprehensive Metrics**:
   - **ROUGE Scores**: Measuring overlap between generated and reference summaries
     - ROUGE-1: Unigram overlap (individual words)
     - ROUGE-2: Bigram overlap (word pairs)
     - ROUGE-L: Longest common subsequence
   - **BLEU Scores**: Measuring precision in n-gram overlap
     - BLEU-1: Unigram precision (individual words)
     - BLEU-2: Bigram precision (word pairs)
     - BLEU-4: 4-gram precision (longer phrases)
   - **Summary Statistics**:
     - Length (character count)
     - Number of sentences
     - Lexical diversity (unique tokens / total tokens)

## Evaluation Results

### Overall Performance

The fine-tuned model shows strong performance across different text categories, with an average ROUGE-1 F1 score of 0.7021 using default parameters. Performance varies by text category:

| Text Category | ROUGE-1 F1 | ROUGE-2 F1 | ROUGE-L F1 |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Narrative Text | 0.9200 | 0.8776 | 0.9000 |
| Medium News | 0.7470 | 0.7160 | 0.7470 |
| Technical | 0.6526 | 0.6452 | 0.6526 |
| Abstract | 0.6486 | 0.6389 | 0.6486 |
| Short Factual | 0.5424 | 0.3860 | 0.5085 |
| **Overall Average** | **0.7021** | **0.6527** | **0.6913** |

### Parameter Impact

Different parameter settings yield notably different results:

| Parameter Set | ROUGE-1 F1 | ROUGE-2 F1 | ROUGE-L F1 |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| default | 0.7021 | 0.6527 | 0.6913 |
| more_diverse | 0.5150 | 0.4315 | 0.4749 |
| more_focused | 0.7241 | 0.6917 | 0.6575 |

The "more_focused" parameter set generally achieves the highest ROUGE scores, making it well-suited for applications where precision is critical.

### Key Observations

1. **Text Type Sensitivity**: The model performs best on narrative and news content, while more abstract or technical content presents greater challenges.

2. **Parameter Tuning**: Generation parameters significantly impact summary quality and should be adjusted based on the specific use case and text type.

3. **Strengths**:
   - High fluency in generated summaries
   - Good factual accuracy
   - Effective content selection (identifying key points)

4. **Areas for Improvement**:
   - Handling of abstract concepts
   - Maintaining consistent lexical diversity
   - Better performance on shorter, more factual texts

## Visualizations

The evaluation framework generates visualizations to help interpret results:

1. **ROUGE-1 by Category**: Compares performance across different text types
2. **ROUGE-1 vs ROUGE-2**: Analyzes the relationship between different ROUGE metrics

These visualizations are saved in the `evaluation/results/plots` directory.

## Running Evaluations

The project provides two evaluation scripts:

1. **Simple Evaluation** (`evaluation/simple_evaluation.py`):
   - Quick assessment of model performance
   - Tests on a small set of examples
   - Outputs basic ROUGE metrics

2. **Comprehensive Evaluation** (`evaluation/comprehensive_evaluation.py`):
   - Thorough assessment across text categories
   - Tests multiple parameter settings
   - Generates visualizations and detailed reports

Both scripts save results to the `evaluation/results` directory with timestamped filenames.

## Conclusion

The evaluation results demonstrate that our fine-tuned model is well-suited for summarizing a variety of text types, with particularly strong performance on narrative and news content. The model's versatility makes it appropriate for the diverse document types that users may want to summarize with the Smart Notes Summarizer.

Future work will focus on improving performance on technical and abstract content, as well as refining the model's ability to handle shorter factual texts.
